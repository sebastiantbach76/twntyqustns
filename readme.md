<span style="font-size:32px; font-weight:600;">T</span>his <span style="color:red; font-weight:800;">Java</span> program merely <em>simulates</em> an artificial
intelligence learning to play a game of Twenty Questions by prompting the player for answers and questions and recording them as part of a decision tree in an external
text file. Accordingly, although the external text file already includes a single question, playing the game to completion several times is necessary before the program
<em>learns</em> to play a more robust game of Twenty Questions. The chief aim of the assignment was to demonstrate my ability to design and implement a decision tree to facilitate the simulated learning mechanism of the program.
